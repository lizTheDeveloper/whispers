// test/table-authority-live-approval.test.ts — socket half
//
// The host chooses exactly one lane: run the table as DM, or play a
// character in it. When they choose to play, there is no human left to
// approve other players' characters — the AI DM's own validation has to be
// the decision, or a submitted character sits in review forever and the
// game can never start. These prove that path end to end over real sockets,
// and that choosing 'dm' (the default, and every campaign created before
// roles existed) is unaffected.
//
// Kept in its own file (not alongside table-authority.test.ts's
// persistence-half describes, which import src/server/db.js at module scope)
// so this file's first import of db.js — transitively, via startHarness() —
// is the one that sets DATA_DIR. The first test below asserts against
// harness.dataDir directly, so a regression here fails loudly on its own.
